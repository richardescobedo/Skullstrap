Skullstrap
==========

Skullstrap is a custom version of Twitter's Bootstrap for use on the Phi Kappa Sigma, Beta Theta website.

Most of the customizations are within the LESS files provided by Bootstrap, which allow variables to be overriden across all of the project's CSS.

In addition to Bootstrap, this repository contains FontAwesome icons as well as Retina.JS, which allows the use of high-resolution images across retina and non-retina displays. Furthermore, any static images are copyrighted intellectual property. There are two versions of every image, one for use on high resolution displays, and one for non-retina displays. 
This repository contains static HTML files, which are used for testing. They are not included in production.
